First, each first index of a 3D array would be 64 bytes, so magic8ball[3] starting address would be at the hex address of 64*3, which is 192. 192 in hex would be c0. so in this case, the starting address would be 0x7fffffffe0c0. Each second index of a 3D array would be 8 bytes, so magic8Ball[3][4] starting address would be 192+4*8=224, which in this case would be e0. Therefore, the address we are looking for is 0x7fffffffe0e0. For magic8Ball[3][4] would be all values stored in the entire line of 0x7fffffffe0e0. The values that are important are 0x57, 0x72, 0x6f, 0x6e, and 0x67 in this order. If we convert this using the ASCII Table, the output of returned by the statement printf(“%s”, magic8ball[3][4]); would be the string 'wrong'.
